MintyLightningMod 


Installation :
It is recommended to let Nexus Mod Manager install the files 

Manual Installation :
Copy the contents of the archive into SkyRim/Data
Ensure the Lightning During Thunder Storms mod is checked within Data options in splash screen.

*** If upgrading from a previous version please create a clean save before installing ***

Or you could try the following (quote taken from the SkyUI page)

"Problem: There are mods missing from my MCM list. Is there anything I can do about it?

Before starting to reinstall mods, you can try to run a repair script we added in SkyUI 3.2.
To do this, open the console and enter "setStage SKI_ConfigManagerInstance 1" (without the quotes)."

See the following resources for more information on creating a clean save :
