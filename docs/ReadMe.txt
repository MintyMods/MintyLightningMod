=============================================================

Change Log:v18 - Repacked and uploaded to include missing parent scripts.

Change Log:v15,16,17 - Corrupted upload causing CTD when saving! 

Change Log:v14 (12/13/14)
Re-uploaded to resolve deployment issues with CK and NMM 
Corrected version number displayed in game to 14.0 - skipping 12 & 13 due to deployment issues on Steam Workshop.
By Request (RavenousRaven9) Corrected the default bloom animation times which was causing a white out!
By Request (phaota) data directory added to archive to support NMM
By Request (xNoobxSaibotx): Fork strike sound changed to one more thunderbolt like ;o) THUNDER :o)
By Request (jacktthompson): Flaged which settings are the defaults within the menus before they are changed.
By Request (arlie0527): Smoke added to burning effect after a strike.
Major increments (12/13/14/etc) are due to how Steam workshop handles versioning of uploads!

12 *NEW* Sheet effects (created by PlayerTwo)
Code rework to allow more control over both fork and sheet strikes.
