Small mod to provide lightning strike effects during thunder storms.
I was always disappointed with the lack of actual lightning during thunder storms and thought this was due to a bug that would be fixed (the ground would light up but never any lightning?). Seeing as it hasn't been fixed yet (as off 1.5 update) - I created this small mod to provide the lightning visuals. The lightning is fork or sheet type and can be configured to either kill or be just a visual effect within the game.

Note: The lightning only strikes during thunder storms.

Other images are from in game screen shots from either myself or other welcome contributers within the comments section (screenies are hard to capture and especialy - 'That Moment'). So thanks for all the submissions. 

Note: It has been reported (by WhipDiddyWhip over @ Nexus) That if used with realistic lighting's esp's then you need to ensure that this mod loads BEFORE that one otherwise the heavy rain is affected and doesn't work.

Change Log: V4
* Better Visual Effects, for both sheet lightning and fork. Still working on these, but I think they are better?
* configurable! There is now a book, on top of the guard house at WhiteRun (Opposite the blacksmiths, BreazeHome, Drunken Huntsman) which will teach you a Spell(Power), and when cast, will allow you to configure the Mod.
* Hidden Ring, (easter egg), that unlocks the 'Debugging Options - which can be fun to play with ;o)'

Change Log: V3
* Supports Sheet lightning with 10% chance to fork at ground
* Player no longer gets blamed for strikes
* Greater distances, no longer always strikes near player
* Only strikes during bad weather now rather than just while raining
