Small mod to provide lightning strike effects during thunder storms.
I was always disappointed with the lack of actual lightning during thunder storms and thought this was due to a bug that would be fixed (the ground would light up but never any lightning?). Seeing as it hasn't been fixed yet (as off 1.5 update) - I created this small mod to provide the lightning visuals. The lightning is fork or sheet type and can be configured to either kill or be just a visual effect within the game.

Note: The lightning only strikes during thunder storms.
*** UPDATED V9.0, See change log below for details ***

Other images are from in game screen shots from either myself or other welcome contributers within the comments section (screenies are hard to capture and especialy - 'That Moment'). So thanks for all the submissions. 

Note: It has been reported (by WhipDiddyWhip over @ Nexus) That if used with realistic lighting's esp's then you need to ensure that this mod loads BEFORE that one otherwise the heavy rain is affected and doesn't work.

* Better Visual Effects, for both sheet lightning and fork. Still working on these, but I think they are better?

* Hidden Ring, (easter egg), that unlocks the 'Debugging Options - which can be fun to play with ;o)'
